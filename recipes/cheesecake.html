    <p>
        Cheesecake is rich dessert that everyone loves. 
        We’re talking dreamy, decadent, creamy, delicious bliss.
         It’s no surprise that cheesecake is my favorite dessert. 
         Which is why I don’t make it often. I can’t help myself from eating it.
          If I know there’s cheesecake in my fridge, that’s all I can think of.
         However, for your sake, my readers, I made this gorgeous
          New York Style Cheesecake. Because let’s face it.
           New York Cheesecake is the best kind.

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
       
           <li>Preheat The Oven
            Before beginning any baking recipe you need to preheat your oven.
             So turn it on to 325°F (163°C) to get it nice and hot.
             Then grab a 9-inch springform pan to have ready for the next step.</li>

             <li>Make The CrustTo begin the crust needs to be made! 
                Add the graham crackers to a food processor and then pulse them a few times
                 until they resemble crumbs. Next, add the melted butter and pulse a few more times.
                 Then transfer the pulsed graham cracker crumbs to a 9-inch springform pan and press 
                 the mixture firmly into the bottom of the pan using the bottom of a measuring cup or
                  glass to make it easier. Now, place the pan into the preheated oven and bake the crust
                 for 10 minutes.</li>

                 <li>Start The Cheesecake Batter While the crust is baking in the oven you
                     can start making the cheesecake batter. Add the room-temperature cream
                      cheese, sugar, flour, and vanilla extract to a large bowl. Then beat the
                       ingredients together with a mixer on medium-high
                     speed until smooth and there are no visible lumps. Next, mix in the sour cream.</li>
                        
                <li>Add The Eggs And Finish The Batter To complete the batter,
                     add the eggs one at a time and mix them into the batter on
                      low speed until well blended. While doing this you may need
                       to scrape down the sides of the bowl and remix. However,
                        it’s crucial that you don’t overmix the batter.
                     Then pour the batter into the baked graham cracker crust.</li>

                     <li>Seal The Pan Before you can put the springform pan into a water
                         bath you need to seal the bottom of it with aluminum foil so that
                          the cheesecake can’t leak out. To do this, cut two long pieces (about 20 inches)
                           of foil and place them on top of each other perpendicularly. Now, place the
                            springform pan on top of the foil, fold up the sides, and crimp to cover 
                            the bottom of the pan.</li>

                            <li>Make A Water Bath To properly bake, you need to make a water bath for the
                                 cheesecake. So place the aluminum-wrapped springform pan into a larger roasting
                                  pan. Then fill the pan about halfway with boiling water. But make sure it does
                                   not go over the foil.</li>

                                   <li>Bake The Cheesecake
                                    To bake, very carefully transfer the cheesecake in the roasting pan
                                     to the oven and bake it for 1 hour and 10 minutes. Then check to see
                                      if the cheesecake is done by shaking the springform pan.
                                     When it’s ready it will be pretty set, but still slightly jiggle 
                                     in the middle.After the cheesecake has come to room temperature you then need
                                      to put it into the fridge for at least 4 hours to set. Overnight is even better. </li>

                                     <li>Once the cheesecake has fully set, top it with the cherry pie
                                         filling. Then slice it and serve it right away to enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
